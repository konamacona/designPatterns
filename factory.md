# Design Patterns: Factory Method

1. What are design patterns?
2. What is the Factory Method pattern?
3. Examples
4. When should it be used?

# Factory Method

The intent of the Factory Method pattern is to...

> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

Which is a fancy way of saying, you can tell a factory which subclass you want constructed, and it will make it for you.

# Factory Method in JavaScript - 1

```js
class Bird {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  fly() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying`);
  }
}
```

---

# Factory Method in JavaScript - 2

```js
class BirdOfPrey extends Bird {
  hunt() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is hunting`)
  }
}

class BirdOfParadise extends Bird {
  tap() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is making mana`)
  }
}
```

---

# Factory Method in JavaScript - 3

```js
class BigBird extends Bird {
  constructor(name, size) {
    super(name)
    this.size = size
  }

  teach() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is teaching`)
  }

  /* override */ fly() {
    if(this.size > 5) {
      throw new Error(`${this.name} is too big to fly :(`)
    } else {
      super.fly()
    }
  }
}
```

# Factory Method in JavaScript - 4

```js
class BirdFactory {
  createBird(type, name) {
    let bird;
    if(type === "ofPrey") {
      bird = new BirdOfPrey(name);
    } else if (type === "ofParadise") {
      bird = new BirdOfParadise(name);
    } else if (type === "big") {
      bird = new BigBird(name, 6);
    }

    return bird;
  }
}
```

---

# Factory Method in JavaScript - 5

```js
const factory = new BirdFactory();

const predator = factory.createBird("ofPrey", "Owl")
predator.hunt() // Owl is hunting
predator.fly() // Owl is flying

const creature = factory.createBird("ofParadise", "Mana Dork")
creature.tap() // Mana Dork is making mana
creature.fly() // Mana Dork is flying

const character = factory.createBird("big", "Big Bird")
character.teach() // Big Bird is teaching
character.fly() // Error: Big Bird is too big to fly :(
```

# When should it be used? 

When you...

* Want to abstract the construction of objects away from the caller
* Need the type of object created to be determined at run-time
* Want a clean and consistent interface for construction of many subclasses
